# Testing N-API with C++

## Requirements
* nvm
* cmake
* ninja (maybe it can use make?)
* Some other stuff but it's handled by npm

## How to build and run (on linux)
* `nvm use`
* `npm install`
* `npm run make`
* `node index.js`

## Extra info
* Based on [this](https://gauriatiq.medium.com/c-native-addon-independent-of-node-js-version-using-napi-node-addon-api-and-cmake-53315582cbd1) article from about a year ago.
* I know some things can be done a lot better
* This repo only exists to show that C++ is a superior language to rust when it comes to making node.js addons.
